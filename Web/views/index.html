        <p>The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.</p>
        <p>Web pages are formatted in a language called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It this language that allows users to click through pages on the Web via links. The Web uses HTTP protocol to transmit data and share information. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are used to access Web documents, or Web pages, which are connected via links.</p>
        <p>The Web is just one of the ways that information is shared over the Internet; others include email, instant messaging and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p>

        <p>A web browser’s primary function is to render HTML, the code that is used to design or “mark up” web pages. When a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may contain text, links, and references to images and other items like CSS and JavaScript functions. </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div id="faq">
      <h3>What are the common bottlenecks for a website not scaling up?</h3>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>CPU Utilization</h4>
            <p>These days—largely due to the rise of mobile devices—it’s the CPU that takes the blame for the most performance slow-downs.</p>
            <p>How we consume the web and interact with applications has changed dramatically, and consumption is no longer relegated to the desktop. In 2018, 66 percent of individuals in 52 key countries will own a smartphone, up from 58 percent in 2016. And while engineers may spend whatever it costs to get the latest from Apple, the fact is that low-cost Android devices are driving internet traffic growth globally. In fact, IDC forecasts that in 2022, Android phones will total over 85 percent of global shipments.</p>
            <p>As websites and apps have become more complex—with software engineers using more JavaScript, more images, and adding layers of complexity that simply weren’t considerations in the mid-2000s—it’s become increasingly vital to pay attention to browser performance on mobile devices, specifically those without a lot of memory or a powerful CPU.</p>
            <p>To avoid this potential bottleneck, fire up your app on devices with varying CPU capabilities and see how it runs using Chrome DevTools to throttle the CPU. And don’t go easy. By pushing it to the limit, you’ll expose the weaknesses in your app or site. These stress tests will make it easier to find performance hiccups, too.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Network Environments</h4>
            <p>Between March 2007 and December 2017, the number of internet users worldwide jumped 37 percent, from just over 1.1 billion to 4.2 billion. And this tremendous internet user growth—particularly in developing markets—brings different network environments with a host of new constraints.</p>
            <p>Latency is a massive problem in some of these regions. In Africa, for instance, many content delivery networks (CDNs) have poor coverage, which often means an end user must access a server on another continent.</p>
            <p>High latency and low bandwidth networks are huge issues in developing markets, but generally not hot topics for conferences or articles. As a result, most developers haven’t spent a lot of time thinking about network considerations in developing regions. But they should.</p>
            <p>To overcome this application performance bottleneck, you need to start with a deep understanding of your target market: what networks people are using, and what considerations and constraints you’ll have to deal with. Without this knowledge, you’re shooting in the dark, and battling performance issues without really knowing what you’re up against.</p>
            <p>Armed with this insight, you can then use Webpagetest to simulate poor network conditions and gain visibility into the impact of different network environments on application performance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Server Performance</h4>
            <p>If you’re only monitoring the front-end and not paying attention to what’s happening in your application on the server, you’re ignoring a huge chunk of your site or application—and potentially setting yourself up for trouble.</p>
            <p>The same client-side bottlenecks and performance glitches can appear on the server, which you must monitor closely to make sure everything is performing as it should. Application performance monitoring (APM) software can help you monitor and detect anomalies before they cause a major problem.</p>
            <p>And when it comes to APM, there’s a significant divide between front-end and backend developers. Sites with JavaScript-heavy front-ends are less likely to use APM, whereas companies that take a more traditional approach of server responding to client, or those with highly complex back ends, are more likely to have an APM solution in place already. But in truth, both camps deserve a fully integrated monitoring solution, one that connects what a user is experiencing on the front-end with any processing taking place in the backend, and this is often done through the concept of a Business Transaction.</p>

      <h3>How to address these common bottlenecks?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>At times, you can easily resolve the bottleneck by allocating more resources or people to that work stage or process. That could mean hiring one more QA tester for the sake of more streamlined production flow.</p>
        <p>However, what if the bottleneck requires a particularly scarce resource or hard-to-find expertise? In some cases, the cost of the solution to the bottleneck can be too high.</p>
        <p>Leaving a bottleneck untreated will always cost you more than resolving it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span>Never leave it idle.</span> Because of the ripple effect on the rest of the flow, the bottleneck process should always be loaded at full capacity.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Reduce the strain on the bottleneck.</span> Make sure that work arrives at it in its very best form. If your review process is a bottleneck, ensure that the quality is built in from the start. The work to be reviewed has to be flawless. Each error that the reviewer finds is going to cost you more time and money.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Manage WIP limits.</span> If the work in progress limits are quite liberal in the bottleneck and there is a lot of context switching, consider lowering the WIP limit. If it doesn’t have a WIP limit, consider setting one.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Process work in batches.</span> Some of the operations would take less time if you organized similar work items in batches. However, be cautious. The larger the batch size is, the higher is the risk. The rule of thumb is that a smaller batch is always better, but in the real world, we sometimes have to make compromises.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Add more people and resources.</span> If you can, increase the capacity of the bottleneck to speed up the whole process. However, keep your eyes wide open. As soon as the system's resources are re-distributed, another bottleneck is bound to appear elsewhere in the system.</p>
          </li>

      <h3>What could be possible causes if a http response is generated quickly but it takes time for a http request to be received (by the web server)?</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>The Database was really slow.</li>
          <li>The browser needed to make additional requests to fully render the page.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
      <h3>What would be the fixes for these possible causes?</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><p>compressing your javascript/css files (removing un-necessary white spaces helps)</p></li>
          <li><p>making sure the images are not higher in resolution than what you need</p></li>
          <li><p>combining multiple images into a single image so that instead of multiple HTTP requests, a single HTTP request could be made to grab an image that has multiple icons/graphics (and then only using a portion of that bigger image for each element).</p></li>
          <li><p>Making sure that any old or un-necessary css or javascript files are removed and not loaded.</p></li>
          <li><p>instead of hosting your own public javascript file or css file such as React, Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap, Foundation, etc, use a CDN so that the browser can use a cached version in the browser instead of downloading this file from your own server</p></li>
          <li><p>Just like combining multiple images to a single image, you could also combine all the css files that are often used together as a single css file. Similarly, javascript files that you use together, combine them into a single javascript file as well as minifying or removing line breaks and extra spaces in your file.</p></li>
